"""Reconstructs point-level records from SwingVision's Shots sheet.

Used when the Points/Games sheets are empty — confirmed the case for two
real (non-Pro) exports: SwingVision's point-outcome rollup requires Pro,
but shot-level AI tracking doesn't.

Every point this produces gets `needs_review=True`, always — not just the
ambiguous winner/unforced_error/forced_error subset the direct-parse
transform.py path flags. This is a heuristic *we* invented from raw shot
geometry, not even SwingVision's own (already-distrusted) point classifier,
so it's held to at least the same bar. That's not just caution: the real
Shots data has at least one confirmed case of a `second_serve` shot marked
`Result='Out'` (i.e. a double fault) immediately followed by a
`second_return` shot in the same point, which shouldn't happen if the serve
actually faulted — ace/double-fault detection here uses the serve shot's
own Result as authoritative regardless of what follows, and that ambiguity
is exactly why nothing from this module is ever trusted un-reviewed.
